      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an engineer based in Bothell, WA with experience in software and hardware development. My most recent adventure was developing new artificial limb technologies as a Research Scientist/Engineer. It was after this experience that I discovered a new field that would combine my love of mathematics with my programming and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end I am currently pursing my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Data Science at the University of Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thrive in a creative environment where I can solve problems and puzzles. If you would like to learn more about me or my work, please contact me at SydneyTheEngineer@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;
