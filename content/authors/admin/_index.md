I am an engineer based in Bothell, WA with experience in software and hardware development. My most recent adventure was developing new artificial limb technologies as a Research Scientist/Engineer. It was after this experience that I discovered a new field that would combine my love of mathematics with my programming and communication skills. 

To that end I am currently pursing my master's degree in Data Science at the University of Notre Dame. 

I thrive in a creative environment where I can solve problems and puzzles. If you would like to learn more about me or my work, please contact me at SydneyTheEngineer@gmail.com
